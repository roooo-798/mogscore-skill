# Mog Rating Preview

## Overview

Run the official MogScore `/mog-rating?mode=upload` flow in a visible, headed
browser and return the free AI Face Rating preview JSON. This is not a backend
API, paid AI Face Analysis, or credit-spending workflow.

Do not use headless mode. The local face scan depends on browser graphics
capabilities and can fail as `scanner_unavailable` in headless Chrome.

## Workflow

Prefer Hermes' host browser when it can upload local files and capture network
response bodies:

1. Open `https://mogscore.ai/mog-rating?mode=upload`.
2. Set the local file on the input labeled `Selfie image`.
3. Click `Get Score` or `Get my score`.
4. Capture the `POST /api/reports` JSON response.

If the host browser cannot upload files or capture the response body, run the
bundled script from this skill folder:

```bash
node scripts/run-mog-rating-preview.mjs \
  --browser-executable "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headed \
  --image /absolute/path/to/photo.jpg
```

The script requires Node 20+, `playwright-core`, and a local Chrome-compatible
browser. It does not install or download Chromium.

## Output Contract

Return the JSON object from the host-browser capture or the script. On success,
`ok` is `true`, `previewUrl` is absolute, and `report` contains the free preview
object returned by `POST /api/reports`. On failure, return `error.code` and
`error.message`.

Expected error codes: `upload_input_not_found`, `upload_failed`,
`submit_button_not_found`, `local_scan_failed`, `scanner_unavailable`,
`preview_create_failed`, `preview_response_missing`, `timeout`,
`host_file_upload_unsupported`, `host_network_capture_unsupported`.

## Boundaries

- Process only user-supplied photos that the user has the right to submit.
- Return the free AI Face Rating / Mog Rating preview only.
- Do not describe the output as paid AI Face Analysis or a Full Facial Metrics Report.
- Do not ask for Google login for this workflow.
- Do not claim medical, identity, objective attractiveness, surgery, or guaranteed
  improvement conclusions.
- Do not expose or invent raw landmarks, face mesh data, blendshapes,
  transformation matrices, auth internals, payment internals, or storage internals.

## Common Mistakes

- Do not run headless.
- Do not stop after attaching the image; click `Get Score` or `Get my score`.
- Do not scrape visible score text when `POST /api/reports` is available.
- Do not commit user photos or smoke-test images.
